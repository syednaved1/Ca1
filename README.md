## Current IT Setup

This study will help in analysing the current situation of the companyâ€™s legacy-based connection and
storage system and offer solutions to those legacy-based options, by implementing which the company will
be able to improve their production efficiency and security (Dang et al., 2019). 

Numerous academic studies have made the prediction that people's reliance on the Internet will only grow
over time. There is no answer that is universally applicable because different tasks can be completed
using various combinations of more recent technology, such as cloud services, and a wide variety of 
business domains. Consequently, there is no answer that is one size fits all. It's possible that the 
criteria will shift based on the scope, character, and environment of the endeavour. On the Isle of Man, 
a smaller number of small and medium-sized businesses (hence the term SMEs). The findings of the various 
reports produced by European institutions follow the same pattern. As for the current configuration of the 
company, they make use of traditional IT infrastructure facilities, data centers, servers, networking 
hardware, desktop computers, and enterprise application solutions, installed on-premises for private use 
by the company.
 
On the other hand, for the web hosting of their websites, they make use of traditional web hosting. In 
this configuration, the traditional web host makes use of physical server space to meet the requirements 
of its customers for web hosting. In the conventional web hosting environment, services are now either 
dedicated to a single user or shared among multiple users. Each choice comes with a unique set of benefits.
In addition, they use dedicated hosting, which means that they pay for an entire server rather than 
sharing space on a shared hosting platform. Processor power, frequency band, memory, and storage space on 
hard drives are all measured in a server's unique configuration. The dedicated hosting solution that they
use for their website comes at an extremely high cost. 

In addition, the middleware stack at Animation Explainer is shaky; it links the company's mainframe to an 
enterprise service bus (ESB), on top of which developers toiled to create and install a collection of REST
APIs. These legacy systems are typically crucial components of the underlying infrastructure, but their 
upkeep is prohibitively expensive. They are typically quite complicated and were not made to work with 
other kinds of technology. As a result, many businesses choose a complex architecture of middleware as 
well as connectors to enable them to construct upon core technology developed for various purposes and at
different times.
