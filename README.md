## Current IT Setup

This study will help in analysing the current situation of the company’s legacy-based connection and
storage system and offer solutions to those legacy-based options, by implementing which the company will
be able to improve their production efficiency and security (Dang et al., 2019). 

Numerous academic studies have made the prediction that people's reliance on the Internet will only grow
over time. There is no answer that is universally applicable because different tasks can be completed
using various combinations of more recent technology, such as cloud services, and a wide variety of 
business domains. Consequently, there is no answer that is one size fits all. It's possible that the 
criteria will shift based on the scope, character, and environment of the endeavour. On the Isle of Man, 
a smaller number of small and medium-sized businesses (hence the term SMEs). As for the current configuration of the 
company, they make use of traditional IT infrastructure facilities, data centers, servers, networking 
hardware, desktop computers, and enterprise application solutions, installed on-premises for private use 
by the company.
 
On the other hand, for the web hosting of their websites, they make use of traditional web hosting. In 
this configuration, the traditional web host makes use of physical server space to meet the requirements 
of its customers for web hosting. In the conventional web hosting environment, services are now either 
dedicated to a single user or shared among multiple users. Each choice comes with a unique set of benefits.
In addition, they use dedicated hosting, which means that they pay for an entire server rather than 
sharing space on a shared hosting platform. Processor power, frequency band, memory, and storage space on 
hard drives are all measured in a server's unique configuration. The dedicated hosting solution that they
use for their website comes at an extremely high cost. 

In addition, the middleware stack at Animation Explainer is shaky; it links the company's mainframe to an 
enterprise service bus (ESB), on top of which developers toiled to create and install a collection of REST
APIs. These legacy systems are typically crucial components of the underlying infrastructure, but their 
upkeep is prohibitively expensive. They are typically quite complicated and were not made to work with 
other kinds of technology. As a result, many businesses choose a complex architecture of middleware as 
well as connectors to enable them to construct upon core technology developed for various purposes and at
different times.

## Recommendations 

To begin, the Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) cloud service paradigm is our top choice for the 
Animation Explainer. Decentralizing storage with the aid of IaaS may greatly reduce the frequency and 
severity of outages if done properly. Securer protocols are in place with leading cloud providers like 
AWS, Azure, and IBM compared to in-house data centres (Alouffi et al., 2021). Small businesses typically
lack the resources to hire a full-time security crew, but these services do. With IaaS, you are in charge
of Applications, data, Runtime, Middleware and the vendor is responsible for managing virtualization, 
servers, storage and networking from the underlying infrastructure to the software that runs your apps
and data. In contrast, with PaaS, you are solely responsible for managing your data, runtime and 
applications, whereas, in SaaS, your supplier handles everything.

## Cloud Web Hosting
●	Only for essential services will people fork out money. The majority of cloud hosting services
     operate on a pay-as-you-go basis.
●	The burden is distributed across several servers. When you use cloud hosting, the bandwidth 
     requirements of your site are distributed among numerous computers.
●	Outstanding availability is guaranteed. Given that a cluster of servers works together to maintain 
     each hosted site, outages are extremely uncommon unless there is a major power failure. The 
     performance of other websites hosted on the same server won't change if one of them encounters 
     downtime or a sudden spike in traffic (Subramanian and Jeyaraj, 2018).
●	It may be expanded as needed. Companies that provide hosting via the cloud make use of elastically 
     scalable virtual servers.

## Benefits of Cloud Infrastructures over Non-Cloud


cloud services are "on-demand," meaning they may be activated or cancelled on a case-by-case basis, the expenses associated with using them can be better managed (Alam, 2020).  The right decision can be made by the requirements of the enterprise.In the case of animation explainer the adaption of cloud is beneficial which will increase the efficiency, scalability and profit of the company.
 


                                                                                            
## Deployment
Non cloud: The resources are deployed within the IT infrastructure of enterprise. It is their responsibility to look after and maintain the resources and provide solutions for troubleshooting.
  
Cloud: There are different kinds of cloud models Such as private   cloud, public cloud, and hybrid cloud. The cloud provider is responsible for all the resources maintenance and troubleshooting.

## Cost
Non Cloud: The enterprise pay huge amount for regular cost of server hardware, Space and power consumption.it is very expensive, 

Cloud: The enterprise which chooses cloud computing model need to pay only for the resources they use. Depending on the uses and the consumptions, the price adjusts Up and down with no upkeep cost and maintenance charges and it is highly scalable.



## Security 
Non cloud: sectors such as government and banking industries have Sensitive information, its privacy and security which an on premises provides. Security is primary issue for some enterprises therefore they use on premises environment but it comes with high cost and maintenance.

Cloud: The biggest obstacle to the adoption of cloud computing is still security concerns. Cloud security breaches have been widely reported, and this has worried IT organizations all around the world. The hazards to security range from employee personal information like login credentials to the theft of intellectual property.

## control

NON cloud: local full access and control of data and resources.

cloud: limited control as the services are provided by the third party.( ontech systems,inc.)


## Justifications:
 
1. Adaption of cloud will increase the scalibility,faster deployment and efficiency's of the company

2. It will save huge money which will increase the profit of the enterprise.

3. cloud based services are made for remote access and availability.

4. cloud allows Disaster recovery & data restoration.

5. you get better roi, fewer workload, flexibility and faster revenue     growth.
